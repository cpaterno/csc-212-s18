# Lab 10: Competitive Programming

This week's lab will be a bit different than usual. Instead of covering a particular programming topic, we will hold a mini programming competition on Kattis. At the start of the first lab section, the link to the Kattis competition will be added to this lab, to prevent any students from getting a head-start. Some additional information about problems that may be vague will be detailed below.
