# Lab 10: Competitive Programming

This week's lab will be a bit different than usual. Instead of covering a particular programming topic, we will hold a mini programming competition on Kattis. At the start of the first lab section, the link to the Kattis competition will be added to this lab, to prevent any students from getting a head-start. Some additional information about problems that may be vague will be detailed below.

## Format

**First and foremost, what does competitive programming mean?**

Generally speaking, comptetitive programming involves finding a programmatic solution to a problem given some constraints. These constraints typically consist of a set amount of time during which to code solutions, at the very least, but may also include restrictions on amount of allowed CPU time and memory usage. A code submission is accepted if it implements the solution to the given problem *to specification* (more on this shortly), and it meets all of the given constraints.

**What are the specifications?**

In any competitive programming problem, it is not enough to simply write an algorithm that solves the problem, but it must also be able to read the data in from stdin and write the resulting solution to stdout. Luckily for you, these steps will already have been done for you in the starter code given above, whereas in an actual programming competition this will not be provided.

**So what do we have to do?**

In each starter code file there is an empty function named after the problem with some parameters and a return value. The parameters consist of the input data, put into different variables of appropriate data types for their specific meanings, which will be detailed on a problem-to-problem basis below. These parameters are the data you have to work with for your implementation, and the result returned from your implementation should match the given return type. You should not modify any of the code already provided in the files, but only add code in the provided function.

**How do we submit?**

Once you are satisfied with your solution, you may either upload your **whole file** to Kattis, or copy and paste **all of the code** in the problem file into Kattis by clicking "switch to editor."
